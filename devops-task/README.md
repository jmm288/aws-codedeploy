# Devops Test Task
Thank you for applying to Mode Transportation! We'd like to see how you can build out infrastructure and CI/CD.

## Hello World PHP App
Provided in `src` is a "hello world" PHP app with 2 files.

## Part 1: Infrastructure
Your goal is to set up this app so that it runs on AWS infrastructure. 
You can choose any appropriate AWS technology. Please utilize the AWS Free Tier if you do not have a personal AWS account already. https://aws.amazon.com/free

Your output for this step should be a **single or very few commands** that fully initializes and configures all required infrastructure.
Please **update** this **README** file as part of the solution to **document the execution procedure, assumptions, environment setups, considerations**, etc.

#### The code will be run on a blank AWS account with zero existing resources where you will need to provision everything as part of your infrastructure stack.

TODO: Provide DETAIL steps on how to run your provisioning code

## Part 2: CI/CD
Your goal for this step is to set up an automated build and deployment pipeline. Please use a SaaS provider that has
the ability to be configured entirely by file. GitHub Actions, GitLab, CircleCI, TravisCI, or any other provider with a free tier.

The pipeline steps should be:

1. Check out the repository
2. Install any dependencies
3. Build the application
4. Deploy the code update to AWS

For extra credit, you can come up with a process to display the current version number (defined as the build number)
as an HTTP header or within the web application.

Your deliverable here should be a configuration file that we could run. You can also share access to the SaaS to show us
your own working pipeline.

Good luck!
